# Abstract

I don't know anything about natural language processing and I only know as much about Markov chains as I learned in Linear Algebra class. Still, I think it would be fun to try and make a program that generates quasi-sentences.

# Current status

Right now, it generates really horrible sentences. For instance, check out this one:

> Or people here go to do calculus alex i need help i was too but it was as if i'm
> being a hermit alex i was that joke is nxm is the dorms or had one culture
> sacrificed their noisy peers alex woops lol.
