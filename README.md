# Abstract

I don't know anything about natural language processing and I only know as much about Markov chains as I learned in Linear Algebra class. Still, I think it would be fun to try and make a program that generates quasi-sentences.

# Current status

Right now, it generates basic sentences and supports capitalization, commas, and hyphens. However, it does not support parentheses and quotations. Here are some examples:

> Exhibits one and five were torn from their stupor--staring at him, Grady got to his height, putting a dent in its place.

> Min Zhao is in hand to Marrano.

> Were they on some island, too?

> Best out of the catch to an end.

> who are no windows.

> Wish I'd known that they heard from him.

> It was supposedly of his handheld game console.

> Everyone in the universe.

> That meant at a series of tests to map every function of your 'friend,' and you will make minor adjustments to see that the staff sergeant fired short bursts with his forward momentum.

> That's where you're wrong.

> Next to them in.

> Nonoperations personnel, please clear the threshing floor.

> Near-infrared readings of the light.

> Doors behind and to do in pursuit of the conference table near a place to land and await Alexa's signal.

> Reluctantly, Grady continued to follow procedure for a few hundred meters away.
