# Abstract

I don't know anything about natural language processing and I only know as much about Markov chains as I learned in Linear Algebra class. Still, I think it would be fun to try and make a program that generates quasi-sentences.

# Current status

Right now, it generates basic sentences but does not properly support capitalization, parentheses, and quotations. Here are some examples:

> Despite the circumstances to watch these tunnels guarded.

> Clearly you must know, i could no longer exist.

> Get the saic of the btc.

> The nsa guy just stared.

> Dropped out of the entire building.

> Instantaneously he was one of many such bunkers built during the enlightenment-- to see candidate two?

> May i call you?

> Soon the parent organization did as well as body temperature.

> Explain to me outside the radius of the btc came down behind hedrick's odd-shaped craft, he noticed that the majority of their own spies.

> They started clattering down the stairs and to the ground between them.

> Changes that we're here.

> Bide our time together has only begun.

> Civilian government knows who i am very proud of was open, and they began scurrying around to set it forward with your eyes and hands.

> Flocks of nearby pigeons scattered in a moment kulkarni clasped his hands.

> Euros, some asian bills, but also in the next half hour or so, but his eyes.
