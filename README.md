# Abstract

I don't know anything about natural language processing and I only know as much about Markov chains as I learned in Linear Algebra class. Still, I think it would be fun to try and make a program that generates quasi-sentences.

# Current status

Right now, it generates basic sentences and supports capitalization, commas, and hyphens. However, it does not support parentheses and quotations. Here are some examples:

> Teams Alpha, Charlie, and echo, move in from every vector.

> Cotton's movement is an opportunity for us.

> Calculating latitude here involved tracking the movements of an avalanche.

> Hibernity's purpose is to study our minds and create models of how we deal with BTC splinter groups.

> Bertrand Alcot, had been head of the BTC to build things, she thought.

> He's expecting you.

> Prime numbers below one hundred seventy-five feet per second.

> Glancing for any sign of Grady and Alexa followed him down the first time I scheduled a meeting.

> Both men exchanged looks.

> Which type of cellular biological activity--cells dividing in culture.

> Steam tunnels beneath Columbia University Mathematics library at speed--he flipped through the opening.

> She waited for the greater good that I'm supposed to be one.

> Significance is great, but it's not enough that we know there aren't any bombing trial.

> Still, he examined it carefully before taking hold of the BTC wasn't put in charge, details of this technology.

> Imagine a situation where you go in circles, getting closer with every revolution and spinning faster.
